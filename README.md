The Ceasar Cipher program takes a string of text and returns a new string with each of it's individual letters shifted into a new letter according to the shift difference stated.

for instance

```rb
ceasar_cipher("(Top), 30", 5) output = "(Ytu), 30"
ceasar_cipher("Daniel's car", 7) output = "khupl's jhy"
ceasar_cipher("Ceasar's Cipher.") output = "Fhdvdu'v Flskhu."
```
